          Voyager 1 was the first mission to explore the outer planets,
          photographing Jupiter, Saturn, and their moons. Using the alignment
          of the planets, it was able to travel to the outer reaches of the 
          Solar System. As it currently stands, Voyager 1 is the furthest
          man-made object from the Sun.

        <p>
          Although launched sooner than Voyager 1, Voyager 2 took a longer
          route through the Solar System. It provided us with new imagery
          of Jupiter and Saturn and our first up close images of the ice
          giants Uranus and Neptune. All of the outer planet's primary moons
          were also photographed.
